## The Problem We're Solving

-   In India, a developing country with over 12 million graduates entering the workforce every year, competition for jobs is intense ‚Äî across sectors like IT, banking, healthcare, teaching, law, and business.
-   Only 20-30% of candidates clear interviews in their first attempt. The gap isn't just technical skills ‚Äî it's the struggle with communication, confidence, articulation, body language, and handling pressure.
-   According to research, resume-based hiring predicts job success with just 10% accuracy. What truly matters in interviews is how you present yourself, how clearly you communicate, and how confidently you respond.
-   In a country where 65% of the population is under 35, this isn't just an individual problem ‚Äî it's a serious barrier for career growth and national development.

## How It Works

VocalHire leverages the power of voice to create an immersive and effective interview practice environment.

-   **üéôÔ∏è Voice-Based Mock Interviews:** Experience realistic interviews where an AI interviewer asks questions with a human-like voice. You respond verbally, and your answers are transcribed in real-time.
-   **üìö Diverse Categories & Roles:** Choose from a wide range of domains like IT, Banking, Healthcare, Law, and more, with specific roles to tailor your practice.
-   **üëÅÔ∏è Proctored Environment:** The AI monitors your body language, eye contact, and focus, providing alerts for distractions like switching tabs, helping you maintain a professional demeanor.
-   **üåê Multilingual Support:** Practice in the language of your choice. The AI can conduct interviews in various languages, understanding and responding to you fluently.
-   **ü§ñ AI Mentor & Resume Analysis:** Upload your resume or job description, and the AI will tailor questions accordingly. A 24/7 AI chatbot is available to provide tips, answer questions, and help refine your resume.
-   **üìä Instant, Detailed Feedback:** Receive a comprehensive PDF report after each interview, analyzing your communication, technical responses, body language, and soft skills, with actionable suggestions for improvement.
-   **üìà Track Your Progress:** All your past interviews and feedback are saved, allowing you to track your improvement over time.
